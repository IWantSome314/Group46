                <p>As you inch forward in the dimly lit space, you're faced with two haunting choices. To your left, stands a firmly shut door from which the sound of a dog growling reverberates, striking a chord of both apprehension and curiosity within you. To your right, a long, shadowy corridor stretches forth, punctuated by the faint, rhythmic banging on a distant door, as if someone or something is desperately trying to escape.</p>                <br>
                <p>Now, you must rely solely on your auditory senses to make your next decision. Listen closely to the two audio snippets provided: one captures the foreboding ambiance of the corridor, while the other houses the menacing sounds behind the door. Your choice here is critical, for it will determine the path you take through this nightmare. Choose wisely.</p>
