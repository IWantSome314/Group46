                As the clock strikes midnight, you stand before the grand, dilapidated mansion that whispers tales of its haunted past through the creaking of its old bones. The old wooden door groans as it swings open, inviting you into the shadowy depths of the house. Thunder rumbles ominously in the distance, and a cold wind sends shivers down your spine as you step inside. Flickering candlelights cast ghostly shadows on the walls, and an inexplicable chill tells you that you are not alone. The legend says that the house is a monstrous labyrinth, filled with ghastly creatures lurking in the darkness, waiting for the unsuspecting. Somewhere, deep within these cursed walls, your friend is trapped, crying out for help. Can you brave the terrors within and uncover the secrets held tight by the twisted corridors? With nothing but your wits and courage, you must solve the riddles that guard the path to your friend's salvation—or meet your grim fate at the hands of the lurking horrors.
