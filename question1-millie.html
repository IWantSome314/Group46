                <p>As you step into the shadowy foyer of the mansion, a sense of unease grips you tightly. Before you, two potential paths beckon for your attention: an old, mysterious door that stands slightly ajar, its hinges whispering secrets of the past, and a daunting staircase that creaks under the weight of its ominous history, leading up into the engulfing darkness. 

                To determine what direction to take, answer this riddle... but remember, your decision here is crucial, as it will guide you toward either safety or peril in your quest to rescue your friend...</p>
